# shellter

## Introduce

Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool, and the first truly dynamic PE infector ever created.

It can be used in order to inject shellcode into native Windows applications \(currently 32-bit applications only\).

The shellcode can be something yours or something generated through a framework, such as Metasploit.
